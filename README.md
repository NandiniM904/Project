# Project
A dynamic web app using the LAMP stack, deployed on two VirtualBox VMs: one as a web server (Apache, PHP) and the other as a database server (MySQL). Users can submit data via a form, which is stored remotely and displayed dynamically. The project simulates real-world client-server architecture.
